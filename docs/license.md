Open source is not a easy staff, please respect the author's contribution, thank you.

This system has been continuously updated for four years to reach the current project functions. For now, except for the OCR function, other functions have been comparable to the commercial  software! At present, this project has not produced any profit. Based on the author's enthusiasm for power generation with love, it has been found that someone has changed this project for commercial use. I solemnly declare that all consequences arising from the commercialization of this project should be borne by yourself.

Therefore, to avoid disputes, it is not recommended to use commercial products. If you insist on using it, please contact the original author for authorization.

Once again, if you directly use this system in commercial products without contacting the author, this system will not bear any commercial disputes, thank you.
